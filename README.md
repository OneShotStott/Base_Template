# Code Institute User Centric Frontend Webpage

## Welcome.

### The purpose of this project was to create a better understanding of several features in Git, GitHub using previous lessons learned with HTML and CSS.

#### We were tasked with pulling logo images off of Google Images to be displayed withing divs.
#### I found that not all of them were the same dimensions and were not displayed in an aesthetically pleasing way, so edited them in Photoshop so they had the same display parametres, these, I then uploaded to Imgur and linked them, they are now all the same dimensions and symmetrical.
#### Further to this, we were also tasked with creating links underneath the software logos, stating the software name and then leading the user to the respective Wikipedia page, detailing all relevant info regarding the software.

#### This project proved incredibly frustrating for me, despite it being incredibly well taught by Matt from CI, I had no internet access for much of the COVID-19 lockdown and was stuck with an issue of not being able to open a port 8000 to see if my code was even working as well as my CSS not functioning. Howevr, this was an incredibly humbling and informative lesson that has really helped me in my journey with Code Institute, the community on Slack was so helpful and enabled me to find my issue, resolve it and move forward, the great staff at StudentCare were also very supportive and helped me as well.
